Description: Differential analyses and Enrichment pipeline for bulk 'ATAC-seq' data
  analyses. This package combines different packages to have an ultimate package
  for both data analyses and visualization of 'ATAC-seq' data. Methods are described in 
  'Karakaslar et al.' (2021) <doi:10.1101/2021.03.05.434143>.
